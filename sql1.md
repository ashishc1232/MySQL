Great question üëç You want a **complete explanation of Data & Information, Database concepts, SQL-like operations, keys, and examples with Excel-style tables.**
I‚Äôll break it into parts with examples so you can easily explain/teach this.

# üìå **1. Data vs Information**

* **Data** ‚Üí Raw facts (numbers, text, images) without meaning.
* **Information** ‚Üí Processed data that makes sense and helps in decision-making.

üëâ Example:

* Data: `78, 65, 92`
* Information: ‚ÄúStudent Ashish scored **78 in Math, 65 in Science, 92 in English**.‚Äù

# üìå **2. Excel Table Examples**

### (a) **Employee & Salary Table**

| EmployeeID | Name   | Department | Salary |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------ |
| 101        | Amit   | IT         | 50,000 |
| 102        | Neha   | HR         | 45,000 |
| 103        | Rajesh | IT         | 60,000 |
| 104        | Priya  | Finance    | 55,000 |

### (b) **Student & Marks Table**

| RollNo | Name   | Subject | Marks |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ----- |
| 1      | Ashish | Math    | 78    |
| 2      | Neha   | Science | 65    |
| 3      | Rohan  | English | 92    |
| 4      | Ankit  | Math    | 88    |

### (c) **Sales Order, Customer & Products**

**Customer Table**

| CustID | CustName | City      |
| ------ | -------- | --------- |
| C01    | Ramesh   | Delhi     |
| C02    | Sita     | Mumbai    |
| C03    | Arjun    | Bangalore |

**Product Table**

| ProdID | ProdName | Price  |
| ------ | -------- | ------ |
| P01    | Laptop   | 50,000 |
| P02    | Mobile   | 20,000 |
| P03    | Tablet   | 30,000 |

**Sales\_Order Table**

| OrderID | CustID | ProdID | Qty | Total  |
| ------- | ------ | ------ | --- | ------ |
| O101    | C01    | P01    | 1   | 50,000 |
| O102    | C02    | P02    | 2   | 40,000 |
| O103    | C03    | P01    | 1   | 50,000 |
| O104    | C01    | P03    | 1   | 30,000 |

# üìå **3. SQL-like Operations**

### üëâ Insert (Add Record)

```sql
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (105, 'Karan', 'IT', 48000);
```

### üëâ Update

```sql
UPDATE Employee SET Salary = 65000 WHERE EmployeeID = 103;
```

### üëâ Delete

```sql
DELETE FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeID = 104;
```

### üëâ Select (Filter)

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE Department = 'IT';
```

### üëâ Sort (Asc/Desc)

```sql
SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary ASC;
```

### üëâ Grouped Data (Aggregate Functions)

```sql
SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Department;
```

* **Min Salary**: `SELECT MIN(Salary) FROM Employee;`
* **Max Salary**: `SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee;`
* **Avg Salary**: `SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employee;`
* **Sum Salary**: `SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM Employee;`
* **Count Employees**: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee;`

---

# üìå **4. Keys & Relationships**

### (a) **Primary Key (Unique Identifier in Table)**

* Example: `EmployeeID`, `RollNo`, `CustID`, `ProdID`

### (b) **Foreign Key (Reference from Another Table)**

* Example: In `Sales_Order`, `CustID` is a **foreign key** (links to Customer table).
* `ProdID` is a **foreign key** (links to Product table).

### (c) **One-to-One Relationship**

* Example: One employee has **one PAN card**.
  Employee ‚Üî PAN.

### (d) **One-to-Many Relationship**

* Example: One customer can place **many orders**.
  Customer ‚Üî Sales\_Order.

### (e) **Unique Key Examples**

* PAN No., Aadhaar No., Passport No., Vehicle No. ‚Üí Always unique but not primary key in all cases.

# üìå **5. Database Concepts**

### **Database**

* Organized collection of data (tables, files).
* Example: Employee database with Employee table, Salary table.

### **DBMS (Database Management System)**

* Software to manage data (Insert, Update, Delete, Retrieve).
* Example: MS Access, Excel, File-based systems.

### **RDBMS (Relational DBMS)**

* Special type of DBMS that stores data in **tables with relationships**.
* Supports SQL.
* Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.

üëâ **Difference**

| Feature        | DBMS (File-based) | RDBMS (Table-based) |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Data Storage   | Files             | Tables (Relations)  |
| Keys/Relations | Not supported     | Supported           |
| Example        | MS Access         | MySQL, Oracle       |
